# Ping Sweeper

## Software Summary

Only using Bash, this script will ping all IP addresses within a range that you specify and output back the IP addresses that are responding.

## Built With

* Bash 5.2

## Version History 

**Version 0.1**  
*5/3/2024*  
* This script is functional already, but I don't want to call it done yet.
* I would like to make further tweaks to it before listing it as Version 1.0.
* I also need to find out why there is a "command not found" error when you redirect the output to a file (even though it still works).

I've begun the "Practical Ethical Hacking" course by TCM Security Academy (taught by Heath Adams).  Shout out to them for getting me started with learning Bash.
